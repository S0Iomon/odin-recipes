# odin-recipes

this project is a simple website of two different recipes.

This project would show my capabilities such as being able to create different pages for each section (home, alfredo, and frozen yoghurt), secure the user's privacy when opening another tab, code the boilerplate for html files, understand the differences of the types of text contents (paragraphs, headings, etc.), make both unordered and ordered lists, insert images, and make links for clients to access.
