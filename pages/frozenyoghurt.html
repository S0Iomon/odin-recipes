    <p class="intro">When it comes to making your own frozen yogurt at home, 
    the consistency can be tricky because when you freeze yogurt, 
    the water component of it forms crystals causing your fro-yo to be 
    more on the icy than creamy side. Even if you're not expecting it to be as 
    creamy as ice cream (which it will not fully be), there are a few tips easy tips 
    that can help you make a creamier frozen yogurt at home.

    <h2 class="section">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups frozen sliced fruit</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>Honey and sugar to sweeten.</li>
            <li>Orange or Vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Corn syrup.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3 class="section">Procedures</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You do not need an ice cream maker to make this easy frozen yogurt 
            recipes, your food processor or a good blender is just fine! 
        </li>
        <li>To make frozen yogurt from scratch using your food processor, all you do is add 
            your sliced frozen fruit, Greek yogurt, honey and sugar to sweeten, orange 
            extract, and a little corn syrup to your food processor. 
        </li>
        <li>From there, just blend until everything is well combined into a smooth, 
            creamy mixture that is almost like a milk shake or thick smoothie. 
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the yogurt mixture to the container and smooth the surface.</li>
        <li>Add a piece of parchment to cover the surface of the yogurt mixture, 
            then cover tightly and freeze until it hardens.
        </li>
    </ol>
