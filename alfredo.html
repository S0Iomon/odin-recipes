    <p>First, a bit of back story: It’s interesting to know that Fettuccine Alfredo was 
        originally invented by Alfredo Di Lelio in his mother’s restaurant in Italy in the 
        mid-1900s. The original recipe was very simple and only included butter and cheese, 
        and it wasn’t until much later than cream was added. Nowadays you can find this 
        classic dish on nearly every Italian menu and in every pasta cookbook. Some 
        fettuccine alfredo recipe variations use eggs, others use light cream to create a 
        decadent alfredo sauce with parmesan. I’ve tried several different preparation 
        methods, and this easy fettuccine alfredo recipe is by far my favorite. 
        It uses heavy whipping cream for the creamiest, tastiest fettuccine alfredo ever!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Cooking Pasta</h3>
        <li>226 grams fettuccine – ½ pound</li>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>1 to 1.5 teaspoons salt or add as required</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Other Ingredients</h3>
        <li>3 to 4 tablespoons Butter – 30 grams, unsalted or salted</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic – finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup whipping cream</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons parmesan cheese – 50 grams, vegetarian</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper or add as required</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h3>Cooking Fettuccine</h3>
        <li>In a deep pan or a sauce pan add water and salt. Stir. </li>
        <li>Place saucepan on stove top and bring the water to a boil on high heat. </li>
        <li>Once the water comes to a boil, add the fettuccine pasta or other pasta of choice.
        Use a spoon to push the fettuccine down into the boiling water as they soften, 
        until fully submerged.></li>
        <li>Cook pasta according to package instructions or until the al dente. 
        That means cooked through but with a slight bite. Boil fettuccine on 
        medium to high heat.</li>
        <li>Drain the water, making sure to save and set aside about a ½ cup of the cooked pasta water. 
        You might want to use a bit to thin out the alfredo sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <h3>Making Alfredo Sauce</h3>
        <li>Meanwhile when the pasta is cooking, begin to make the alfredo sauce. 
            In a large, deep skillet melt salted or unsalted butter on low heat. 
            If using salted butter you’ll want to add less salt to finish the dish.
        </li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted, add chopped garlic. Sauté for a few seconds 
            until the raw aroma of garlic goes away. There is no need to brown the garlic.
        </li>
        <li>Add the whipping cream. 
            Mix well with a wired whisk. Bring the cream to a gentle boil on low heat. 
        </li>
        <li>With a whisk continuously stir as you bring the cream mixture to a low simmer on a 
            low heat. 
            Keep an eye on the cream to ensure it does not get burnt or brown.
        </li>
        <li>Once the cream begins to gently boil, 
            further simmer for 1 to 2 minutes on low heat, until the cream thickens a bit.
        </li>
        <li>Add grated vegetarian parmesan cheese to the cream and mix well.</li>
    </ol>
